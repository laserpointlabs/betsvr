# Betting Glossary & Concepts

## Market Terms
*   **Action**: A bet or wager.
*   **Against the Spread (ATS)**: Betting on a team to cover the point spread.
*   **Bad Beat**: A bet that looks like a winner but loses late due to a fluke play.
*   **Chalk**: The favorite.
*   **Closing Line Value (CLV)**: Comparing the odds you bet vs. the odds at kickoff. If you bet Chiefs -2.5 and they close at -3.5, you have positive CLV (you beat the market), which is a sign of a sharp bettor.
*   **Handle**: The total amount of money wagered on a game.
*   **Hold**: The percentage the sportsbook keeps as profit.
*   **Juice / Vig**: The commission (e.g., -110 odds means you bet $110 to win $100. The $10 is the juice).
*   **Push**: A tie. You get your money back.
*   **Sharp**: A professional, sophisticated bettor.
*   **Square**: A recreational, novice bettor.
*   **Steam**: Sudden, heavy line movement across the entire market, usually caused by sharp money.
*   **Lookahead Spot**: A situational betting angle where a team is looking past their current opponent to a big game next week. Often leads to flat performance.
*   **Buying Points**: Paying extra juice to move the spread in your favor (e.g., buying from -3.5 to -3 or -2.5).
*   **Middle**: Betting both sides of a game at different lines to try to win both bets (e.g., Team A +4 and Team A -2, wins if they win by 2 or 3).
*   **Hedge**: Placing a bet on the opposite side of your original bet to guarantee profit or minimize loss.

## Bet Types
