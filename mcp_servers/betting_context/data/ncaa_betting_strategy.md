# NCAA Football Betting Strategy

## 1. High Variance & Inefficiency
Unlike the NFL, College Football (CFB) has 130+ teams. Oddsmakers cannot monitor every roster as closely as they do the NFL.
*   **Opportunity**: You can find "soft" lines in lower-tier conferences (MAC, Sun Belt, Mountain West).
*   **Volatility**: 18-22 year olds are less consistent than professionals. Blowouts and massive comebacks are more common.

## 2. Power Ratings & Recruiting
Talent gaps in CFB are massive.
*   **Recruiting Classes**: Tracking 3-4 years of recruiting rankings gives you a "Talent Composite" score. A team with 5-star recruits will eventually physically dominate a team of 2-stars, even with worse coaching.
*   **Depth**: Injuries matter more to smaller schools that lack depth. Alabama can replace a starter with a 5-star; a MAC school cannot.

## 3. Motivation is Key
In the NFL, everyone is paid to win. In CFB, motivation varies wildly.
*   **Bowl Games**: Does the team *want* to be there? (e.g., A team disappointed to miss the playoffs playing a smaller school treating this as their Super Bowl).
*   **Letdown Spots**: After a huge upset win, teams often come out flat the next week.
*   **Revenge Games**: College rivalries are intense and emotional.

## 4. The "Number" Matters Less (But Still Matters)
While 3 and 7 are still key numbers, the scoring in CFB is higher and more volatile.
*   **Totals**: Over/Under totals can reach into the 70s or 80s.
*   **Spreads**: You will see spreads of -30 or -40. In these games, "garbage time" (backups playing in the 4th quarter) can ruin a spread bet.

## 5. Totals Strategy (Over/Under)
*   **Tempo**: Look at "Plays Per Game". Some teams run no-huddle (more possessions), others run the play clock down (fewer possessions).
*   **Weather**: Wind is the enemy of the passing game and the "Over". Rain/Snow favors the "Under" slightly, but **Wind > 15mph** is the strongest correlation to Unders.

## 6. Weather Impact on Betting
*   **Wind**: If wind speeds exceed 15 mph, strongly favor the Under. Wind disrupts passing accuracy and kick distance.
*   **Rain**: Slight edge to the Under (5-10% increase in Under hit rate). More fumbles, harder to throw.
*   **Snow**: Similar to rain, but extreme snow (>6 inches) can create total chaos - avoid betting these games.
*   **Cold**: Temperature alone (<20°F) has minimal impact. It's the wind that matters.

## 7. Bye Week & Rest
*   **Coming off Bye**: NFL teams off a bye perform slightly better ATS (~53% vs 50%). Not a huge edge but worth considering.
*   **Short Rest (Thursday games)**: Road teams on Thursday Night Football (TNF) are at a significant disadvantage. Fade road favorites on TNF.
