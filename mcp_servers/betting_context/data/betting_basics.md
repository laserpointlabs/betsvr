# Betting Guide: Basics for Dummies

## What is a Moneyline?
The moneyline is the simplest bet in sports. You are simply picking who will win the game.

- **Negative Number (e.g. -150)**: This indicates the favorite. You must bet $150 to win $100.
- **Positive Number (e.g. +130)**: This indicates the underdog. If you bet $100, you win $130.

## What is the Spread?
The point spread levels the playing field between two teams.
- **-3.5**: The team must win by 4 or more points.
- **+3.5**: The team can lose by 3 points or less, or win outright.

## What is Over/Under (Total)?
You are betting on the combined score of both teams.
- **Over 45.5**: The combined score must be 46 or more.
- **Under 45.5**: The combined score must be 45 or less.
