# Betting Decision Framework

## When Analyzing a Bet, Consider:

### 1. The Line (from live odds)
- **Spread**: Is it on a key number (3, 7, 10, 14)?
- **Total**: Is it historically high or low for this matchup?
- **Moneyline**: What's the implied probability?

### 2. Injury Impact
**Key Questions to Ask:**
- Is the starting QB healthy? (Worth 6-7 points to the spread for elite QBs)
- Are key offensive weapons out? (WR1, RB1)
- Defensive injuries matter less unless it's a star pass rusher or CB

**Where to Check:**
- ESPN injury report
- Team Twitter/beat reporters
- Friday injury reports are most reliable

### 3. Weather Conditions
**Check the forecast before betting:**
- **Wind > 15 mph**: Strong lean to Under. Disrupts passing and kicking.
- **Rain/Snow**: Slight lean to Under (5-10% edge). More fumbles.
- **Cold alone (<20°F)**: Minimal impact. It's the wind that matters.
- **Dome games**: No weather concerns.

### 4. Matchup Context
- **Division games**: Often closer than the spread suggests (familiarity)
- **Primetime games**: Tend to stay closer (teams bring their A-game)
- **Blowout risk**: If spread is >14, garbage time can ruin spread bets

### 5. Situational Spots
- **Lookahead**: Team has a huge game next week → Bet against them
- **Revenge game**: Team lost to this opponent earlier in season → Small edge
- **Short rest (Thursday)**: Fade road favorites
- **Off bye**: Slight edge to bet ON the rested team

## Recommendation Template

When a user asks for odds on a game, provide:

1. **The Lines** (from get_odds tool)
2. **Key Factors to Consider**:
   - "Check injury report for [QB name]"
   - "Weather forecast shows [wind/rain/clear]"
   - "This is a divisional matchup - expect it close"
3. **Suggested Plays** (if clear edge exists):
   - "If [QB] is playing, Chiefs -3.5 has value"
   - "Under 42.5 is strong if wind exceeds 15mph"
4. **Sizing Recommendation**:
   - "With a [$X] bankroll, bet 1-2 units ($Y-$Z)"
