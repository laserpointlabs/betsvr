# Bankroll Management & Risk Control

## 1. The Foundation: Bankroll Definition

### What is a Bankroll?
Your bankroll is money **specifically allocated for betting** that you can afford to lose 100%.

**Critical Rules:**
- Never bet rent/mortgage money
- Never bet money earmarked for bills
- Never bet emergency fund money
- Consider your bankroll "entertainment money" that's already spent

### Setting Your Initial Bankroll
| Annual Income | Conservative Bankroll | Moderate Bankroll |
|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| $50,000 | $500 (1%) | $1,000 (2%) |
| $75,000 | $750 (1%) | $1,500 (2%) |
| $100,000 | $1,000 (1%) | $2,000 (2%) |
| $150,000+ | $1,500 (1%) | $3,000 (2%) |

**Start conservative.** You can always add more later.

## 2. Unit Sizing: The Language of Pros

### What is a Unit?
A "Unit" (u) is a standardized bet size based on your bankroll.

**Standard Unit Sizing:**
- **Conservative**: 1u = 1% of bankroll
- **Moderate**: 1u = 2% of bankroll
- **Aggressive**: 1u = 3% of bankroll (high risk)

### Example: $1,000 Bankroll
| Style | 1 Unit | Max Single Bet (3u) |
|-------|--------|---------------------|
| Conservative (1%) | $10 | $30 |
| Moderate (2%) | $20 | $60 |
| Aggressive (3%) | $30 | $90 |

### Why Units Matter
- Units normalize your performance across different bankroll sizes
- "+10 units" means the same whether your bankroll is $500 or $50,000
- Allows comparison with other bettors and tracking services

---

## 3. Bet Sizing by Confidence

### The Tiered Approach
| Confidence | Units | Criteria |
|------------|-------|----------|
| Standard | 1u | Normal edge, single factor |
| Confident | 2u | Multiple factors align |
| Max | 3u | Perfect storm: CLV + RLM + Situational + Data |

### When to Size Up (2-3u)
- Reverse Line Movement confirms your side
- Multiple situational angles align (rest, revenge, weather)
- Line crosses key number in your favor
- Your model shows 5%+ edge over implied probability

### When to Size Down (0.5u)
- New bet type you're testing
- High-variance play (parlay, prop)
- Limited information available
- "Entertainment" bets (longshots)

### Never Do This
- **Never bet 5%+ of bankroll on a single game**
- **Never increase bet size after a loss (Martingale)**
- **Never bet your entire bankroll on a "lock"**

---

## 4. The Kelly Criterion

### The Formula
Kelly tells you the optimal bet size to maximize long-term growth.

```
Kelly % = (bp - q) / b

Where:
b = decimal odds - 1 (or American to decimal conversion)
p = your estimated probability of winning
q = 1 - p (probability of losing)
```

### Example Calculation
- You think Chiefs have 58% chance to cover
- Odds: -110 (decimal: 1.91)
- b = 1.91 - 1 = 0.91
- p = 0.58, q = 0.42
- Kelly = (0.91 × 0.58 - 0.42) / 0.91 = 0.12 / 0.91 = **13.2%**

### Full Kelly is Dangerous
Full Kelly assumes you know your exact edge. You don't.

**Recommended Fractional Kelly:**
| Fraction | % of Full Kelly | Risk Level |
|----------|-----------------|------------|
| Quarter Kelly | 25% | Conservative |
| Half Kelly | 50% | Moderate |
| Full Kelly | 100% | Aggressive (not recommended) |

**Using the example above:**
- Full Kelly: 13.2% of bankroll
- Half Kelly: 6.6% of bankroll
- Quarter Kelly: 3.3% of bankroll

---

## 5. Flat Betting vs. Variable Betting

### Flat Betting (Recommended)
Bet the same amount (1u) on every single bet.

**Pros:**
- Simplest to execute
- Protects against losing streaks
- Removes emotional sizing decisions
- Bankroll fluctuates slowly

**Cons:**
- Doesn't capitalize on high-confidence spots
- May underbet strong edges

### Variable Betting
Bet more (2-3u) on high-confidence plays.

**Pros:**
- Maximizes profit on best opportunities
- Theoretically optimal (if your edge is accurate)

**Cons:**
- Your "high confidence" bets aren't always right
- If your 3u bets lose at higher rate, bankroll drains fast
- Emotional biases creep in ("I feel good about this one")

### The Hybrid Approach (Recommended)
- 70% of bets at 1u (standard)
- 25% of bets at 2u (confident)
- 5% of bets at 3u (max, rare)

## 6. Drawdown Management

### What is Drawdown?
Drawdown = Peak bankroll - Current bankroll

If you started at $1,000, grew to $1,200, and are now at $900:
- Drawdown from peak: $300 (25%)
- Drawdown from start: $100 (10%)

### Expected Drawdowns
Even winning bettors have drawdowns. Here's what to expect:

| Win Rate | Expected Max Drawdown |
|----------|----------------------|
| 52% | 20-30% of bankroll |
| 53% | 15-25% of bankroll |
| 54% | 10-20% of bankroll |
| 55% | 10-15% of bankroll |

**Reality**: A 52% bettor can have 10+ unit losing streaks. Normal.

### Drawdown Rules
1. **If down 20%**: Reduce unit size by 25%
2. **If down 30%**: Reduce unit size by 50%
3. **If down 50%**: Stop betting, reassess strategy
4. **Never chase losses**

---

## 7. Stop-Loss and Take-Profit Limits

### Daily/Weekly Limits
Set rules BEFORE you bet:

| Limit Type | Conservative | Moderate |
|------------|--------------|----------|
| Daily Loss Limit | 3u | 5u |
| Weekly Loss Limit | 10u | 15u |
| Monthly Loss Limit | 25u | 40u |

### How to Implement
1. Hit your daily loss limit → Stop betting until tomorrow
2. Hit your weekly loss limit → Stop until next week
3. **No exceptions**. Close the apps. Go outside.

### Take-Profit Limits (Optional)
Some bettors set win limits to lock in profit:
- "If I'm up 5u for the day, I stop"
- **Controversial**: Your edge doesn't know what time it is
- If you have edge, you should keep betting
- But if you struggle with discipline, take-profit can help

---

## 8. Bankroll Segregation

### Separate Your Money
Don't mix betting bankroll with other finances.

**Recommended Setup:**
1. **Primary bank account**: Bills, savings, life money
2. **Betting account(s)**: DraftKings, FanDuel, etc.
3. **Never transfer from primary to betting mid-week**

### Deposit Cadence
- **Weekly deposit**: Fixed amount at start of week
- **Monthly deposit**: Fixed amount at start of month
- **Never "reload" after a bad day**

### Withdrawal Rules
- Withdraw profits periodically (monthly or quarterly)
- Keeps bankroll at target level
- Psychologically reinforces "this is real money"

---

## 9. Long-Term Bankroll Growth

### The Compounding Effect
If you're a winning bettor, your bankroll grows. Increase unit size proportionally.

**Example: 10% monthly growth**
| Month | Bankroll | 1 Unit (2%) |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | $1,000 | $20 |
| 3 | $1,331 | $27 |
| 6 | $1,772 | $35 |
| 12 | $3,138 | $63 |

### When to Increase Unit Size
- Bankroll up 20% → Increase unit size proportionally
- Keep percentage constant (e.g., always 2%)
- Recalculate monthly

### When to Decrease Unit Size
- Bankroll down 20% → Decrease unit size proportionally
- This is crucial for survival
- Losing bettors who don't adjust go broke

---

## 10. Psychological Bankroll Management

### The Mindset of Pros
- Treat each bet as one of 10,000+ lifetime bets
- Individual results don't matter; process does
- Losing streaks are inevitable and expected
- Winning streaks are also inevitable and don't mean you're a genius

### Emotional Triggers to Watch
| Trigger | Danger | Solution |
|---------|--------|----------|
| Just lost 5 straight | Chase with bigger bet | Walk away, stick to limits |
| Just won 5 straight | Overconfident, sloppy bets | Stick to process |
| "Revenge" on a team | Emotional betting | Remove team from board |
| "Sure thing" | Oversized bet | Cap at 3u max |

### The 24-Hour Rule
After a bad loss:
1. Close all betting apps
2. Wait 24 hours before next bet
3. Review what went wrong (process vs. result)
4. Only bet again when emotion is gone

---

## 11. Bankroll Tracking

### What to Track
| Field | Example |
|-------|---------|
| Date | 12/5/2024 |
| Game | Chiefs vs Ravens |
| Bet Type | Spread |
| Pick | Chiefs -3 |
| Odds | -110 |
| Units | 1u |
| Book | DraftKings |
| Result | Win |
| P/L | +1u |
| Closing Line | Chiefs -3.5 |

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **ROI**: (Profit / Total Wagered) × 100
- **Win Rate**: Wins / Total Bets
- **CLV Average**: Your average closing line value
- **Units Profit**: Net units won/lost
- **By Bet Type**: Which bet types are you best at?

### Spreadsheet vs. Apps
- **Spreadsheet**: Full control, custom tracking
- **Action Network**: Good free tracker
- **SharpSide**: Paid, more analytics
- **Pikkit**: Social + tracking

## 12. Common Bankroll Mistakes

### Mistake #1: No Defined Bankroll
"I just bet whatever I feel like" = Recipe for disaster

### Mistake #2: Betting Too Big
5%+ of bankroll per bet = Broke within months

### Mistake #3: Chasing Losses
Down 3u → Bet 6u to "get back to even" → Now down 9u → Broke

### Mistake #4: Not Tracking
If you don't track, you don't know if you're winning or losing

### Mistake #5: Moving Goal Posts
"I was going to stop at 5u loss, but I'll go to 10u" = No discipline

### Mistake #6: Mixing Life Money with Betting Money
Betting should NEVER affect your ability to pay bills

### Mistake #7: Ignoring Variance
Even 55% bettors have 20+ unit drawdowns. It's math, not failure.
