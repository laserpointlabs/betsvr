# Parlay, Teaser & Multi-Bet Portfolio Strategy

## 1. The Math of Parlays (Why Books Love Them)

### Parlay Odds Calculation
Each leg multiplies the risk. Books pay "true odds" but the compounding works against you.

**Example: 2-Team Parlay at -110 each**
- Each leg: 52.4% win probability
- Both legs: 52.4% × 52.4% = **27.5%** win probability
- True payout should be: 2.64x
- Typical payout: 2.6x
- House edge: ~1.5% per leg compounded

### The Parlay Trap
| Legs | True Odds | Typical Payout | House Edge |
|------|-----------|----------------|------------|
| 2 | 3.64x | 2.6x | 4.0% |
| 3 | 5.96x | 6.0x | 6.5% |
| 4 | 9.77x | 10.0x | 9.0% |
| 5 | 16.0x | 20.0x | 11.5% |
| 6+ | 26.2x+ | 40.0x+ | 15%+ |

**Reality**: Most recreational bettors lose 20-40% of their parlay bankroll annually.

## 2. When Parlays CAN Be +EV

### Correlated Parlays
When outcomes are linked, books sometimes underprice the correlation.

**Positive Correlation Examples:**
| Parlay | Correlation |
|--------|-------------|
| Team ML + Under | Winning team runs clock, slows pace |
| RB Over rushing + Team favored by 7+ | Game script = run heavy |
| QB yards Over + WR1 yards Over | Same passing plays |
| Team -7 + Team TT Over 24 | Need to score to cover |
| Rain + Under | Weather affects both sides |

**How to Exploit:**
- Same Game Parlays (SGP) at books often misprice correlation
- Example: Book prices RB rushing and Team ML independently
- Reality: If team wins by 14, RB likely hit his Over
- Edge: 2-5% on correlated SGPs

### Arbitrage / Positive-EV Parlays
- If you have +EV on EACH leg, the parlay is +EV
- Example: 2 legs, each at 55% true probability
- Parlay probability: 30.25% → needs 3.3x to break even
- If book pays 3.5x+ → +EV parlay

## 3. Wong Teasers: The Exception

### What is a Teaser?
A teaser lets you move the spread in your favor on 2+ teams in exchange for lower odds.

**Standard NFL Teaser:**
- 6 points adjustment
- 2-team teaser pays -120 (bet $120 to win $100)

### The Wong Teaser (Stanford Wong)
Stanford Wong's research showed 6-point teasers crossing key numbers are +EV.

**Qualifying Criteria:**
1. Move a **favorite from -7.5 to -8.5 down to -1.5 to -2.5** (crosses 7, 6, 3)
2. Move an **underdog from +1.5 to +2.5 up to +7.5 to +8.5** (crosses 3, 6, 7)
3. **Never tease through 0** (pushes can lose)

**Historical Performance:**
- Wong teasers hit rate: ~72-74% per leg
- At -120, break-even is ~52% per leg
- Long-term ROI: +5-8%

### Wong Teaser Examples
| Original Line | After 6-pt Tease | Crosses |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Chiefs -7.5 | Chiefs -1.5 | 7, 6, 4, 3, 2 ✓ |
| Bills +2.5 | Bills +8.5 | 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 ✓ |
| Ravens -3 | Ravens +3 | 3, 2, 1, 0 ✗ (crosses 0) |
| Dolphins +6 | Dolphins +12 | 6, 7, 10 ✓ but no 3 |

**Best Wong Plays:**
- Favorites: -7.5 to -8.5 (teased to -1.5 to -2.5)
- Underdogs: +1.5 to +2.5 (teased to +7.5 to +8.5)

## 4. Building a Betting Portfolio

### The Professional Approach
Think of your weekly betting as an investment portfolio, not individual bets.

### Recommended Allocation
| Bet Type | % of Weekly Bankroll | Purpose |
|----------|---------------------|---------|
| Straight Bets (Sides/Totals) | 60% | Core holdings, low variance |
| Wong Teasers | 20% | Proven +EV strategy |
| Correlated Parlays (2-3 legs) | 15% | Moderate risk, high reward |
| Longshot Parlays (4+ legs) | 5% | Entertainment/lottery |

### Weekly Budget Example ($500 bankroll, 10u = $50 weekly risk)
- **Straight Bets**: 6 units ($30) across 3-4 games
- **Wong Teasers**: 2 units ($10) on 1-2 qualifying teasers
- **Correlated Parlays**: 1.5 units ($7.50) on 2-3 leg correlated plays
- **Longshots**: 0.5 units ($2.50) on one 4-6 leg parlay

## 5. Same Game Parlay (SGP) Strategy

### How Books Price SGPs
- Each leg priced independently
- Correlation between legs NOT fully accounted for
- Juice is added on top (typically equivalent to -115 to -130)

### SGP Value Plays

**High Correlation (Often Underpriced):**
| Leg 1 | Leg 2 | Why Correlated |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| Team ML | Under | Winner runs clock |
| RB rushing Over | Team -7 | Favorites run more |
| QB passing Over | WR1 receiving Over | Same plays |
| Team to score first | Team ML | Momentum/game script |

**Low Correlation (Fair Price):**
- First half result vs. Full game result
- Individual props from opposite teams

### SGP Building Process
1. **Start with a side or total you like** (has independent value)
2. **Add a correlated prop** that benefits from same game script
3. **Cap at 2-3 legs** (beyond 3, variance kills you)
4. **Check the final odds** - does correlation make it +EV?

## 6. Managing Parlay Variance

### The Cold Reality
- A 4-leg parlay at 50% per leg hits 6.25% of the time
- You can have 15 straight losses and be "on pace"
- Parlays should be "bonus" bankroll, not core strategy

### Sizing Parlays
| Parlay Legs | Max Unit Size |
|-------------|---------------|
| 2 legs | 1.5u |
| 3 legs | 1.0u |
| 4 legs | 0.5u |
| 5+ legs | 0.25u |

**Never Chase**: If your parlay loses, do NOT double down on the next one.

### Hedging Parlays
When your parlay is alive to the last leg, you can hedge to guarantee profit.

**Example:**
- 3-leg parlay: $10 to win $60
- First 2 legs hit, last leg is Chiefs -3
- You can bet $25 on opponent +3 to guarantee $35 profit
- OR let it ride for potential $60 profit

**When to Hedge:**
- If the guaranteed profit is "life-changing" or significant → Hedge
- If it's entertainment money → Let it ride
- Never hedge small amounts (transaction cost not worth it)

## 7. Avoiding Common Parlay Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Too Many Legs
- Each leg adds ~5-10% house edge
- 6+ leg parlays have 15-25% house edge
- **Limit to 2-4 legs max**

### Mistake #2: Uncorrelated Legs
- Picking 4 random favorites is not a "strategy"
- Each leg should have independent edge OR correlation
- If you can't articulate why each leg, don't bet it

### Mistake #3: Parlaying Heavy Favorites
- Favorites at -300+ have tiny payouts
- You're betting $300 to win $100 per leg
- One upset and you lose $300

### Mistake #4: Chasing Losses
- Lost 5 parlays in a row? Normal variance.
- Do NOT increase parlay size to "make it back"
- Stick to your allocation percentage

### Mistake #5: Public Parlay Cards
- "5-team $5 parlay card wins $100,000!" is marketing
- Those hit 1 in 10,000 times
- Casinos profit massively from parlay cards

## 8. Round Robin Betting

### What is a Round Robin?
A round robin turns 3+ picks into multiple smaller parlays.

**Example: 3 picks (A, B, C) in a 2-leg round robin:**
- Parlay 1: A + B
- Parlay 2: A + C
- Parlay 3: B + C

### Why Use Round Robins?
- If one leg loses, you don't lose everything
- Reduces variance compared to a single 3-leg parlay
- Still captures parlay upside if all legs hit

### Round Robin Math
| Picks | 2-leg RR Parlays | 3-leg RR Parlays |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| 3 | 3 | 1 |
| 4 | 6 | 4 |
| 5 | 10 | 10 |

**Cost**: You're betting more total units for reduced variance

---

## 9. Progressive Parlay Systems (Avoid)

### Martingale Parlays
- Double your parlay after every loss
- "Eventually you'll hit and make it all back"
- **Reality**: You'll hit your bankroll limit or book max before recovery
- **Never use Martingale**

### Fixed Profit Systems
- "I'll bet until I'm up $X for the day"
- Encourages chasing, overextending
- Your edge doesn't know what time it is
- **Avoid fixed profit targets**

## 10. Putting It All Together: Weekly Workflow

### Sunday NFL Example

**Step 1: Identify Straight Bet Value**
- Review lines, find 2-4 games with edge
- Check for RLM, key number value, situational spots
- Allocate 60% of weekly budget to straight bets

**Step 2: Look for Wong Teaser Opportunities**
- Scan for favorites -7.5 to -8.5, underdogs +1.5 to +2.5
- Build 1-2 qualifying 2-team teasers
- Allocate 20% to teasers

**Step 3: Build Correlated SGP/Parlay**
- Take your best straight bet pick
- Add a correlated prop or total
- Keep to 2-3 legs
- Allocate 15% to correlated parlays

**Step 4: Longshot Lottery Ticket (Optional)**
- If you have "fun money," build a 4-6 leg parlay
- Accept it will likely lose
- Allocate 5% max

**Step 5: Track Everything**
- Record each bet: type, legs, odds, stake, result
- Review weekly: which bet types are profitable?
- Adjust allocation toward your strengths
