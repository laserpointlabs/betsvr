# Line Shopping & Value Identification

## 1. Why Line Shopping is Non-Negotiable

### The Math is Simple
- Average bettor pays -110 (52.4% break-even)
- Finding -105 = 51.2% break-even (saves 1.2% edge)
- Over 1,000 bets at $100/bet:
  - At -110: Need 524 wins to break even
  - At -105: Need 512 wins to break even
  - **12 fewer wins needed = $1,200 saved**

### Books Have Different Lines
| Book | Chiefs Line | Juice |
|------|-------------|-------|
| DraftKings | -3 | -110 |
| FanDuel | -3 | -108 |
| BetMGM | -2.5 | -115 |
| Caesars | -3 | -105 |

**Best Bet**: Caesars at -3 (-105) saves you 5 cents per dollar risked.

## 2. Types of Line Value

### Key Number Value
Being on the right side of key numbers (3, 7) is huge in NFL.

**Value Hierarchy:**
1. **+3 at -110 vs. +2.5 at -110** → +3 wins pushes (15% of games)
2. **-2.5 at -110 vs. -3 at -110** → -2.5 wins when game lands on 3
3. **+7 vs. +6.5** → Second most valuable key number
4. **-6.5 vs. -7** → Win those 7-point margins

### Juice Value
Lower juice = better odds for you.

| Juice | Implied % | True Break-Even |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| -100 | 50.0% | 50.0% |
| -105 | 51.2% | 50.6% |
| -110 | 52.4% | 51.2% |
| -115 | 53.5% | 51.9% |
| -120 | 54.5% | 52.6% |

**Rule**: Never pay -115 or worse unless the line itself has major value.

### Alternative Line Value
Some books offer "alternate spreads" with adjusted odds.

**Example:**
- Standard: Chiefs -3 (-110)
- Alternate: Chiefs -2.5 (-120)
- Alternate: Chiefs -1.5 (-135)

**When to Buy Points:**
- Buying from -3.5 to -3: Worth up to -130
- Buying from -3 to -2.5: Worth up to -125
- Buying through 7: Worth up to -125

## 3. Where to Shop Lines

### Tier 1: Major Sportsbooks (Sharp-Friendly)
- **Pinnacle** (gold standard, sharpest lines, lowest juice)
- **Circa Sports** (Vegas-based, very sharp)
- **Bookmaker.eu** (offshore, sharp-tolerant)

### Tier 2: Mainstream US Books
- **DraftKings** (good promos, decent lines)
- **FanDuel** (competitive lines, good app)
- **BetMGM** (average lines, good for parlays)
- **Caesars** (occasional soft lines, heavy promos)

### Tier 3: Regional/Soft Books
- **PointsBet** (spreads can be softer)
- **BetRivers** (regional, occasional value)
- **Barstool/ESPN Bet** (recreational-focused)

### Line Aggregators
- **OddsShark** - Free comparison
- **The Action Network** - Best UI, some features paid
- **Oddsboom** - International coverage
- **VegasInsider** - Classic, reliable

## 4. Sharp vs. Square Lines

### Market Makers vs. Market Takers
- **Pinnacle** = Market maker (sets the "true" line)
- **DraftKings** = Market taker (copies and adjusts)

### Identifying Sharp Value
If a book's line differs significantly from Pinnacle:
- Book has Chiefs -2.5, Pinnacle has Chiefs -3.5
- **Sharp value is on Chiefs at the soft book**
- Pinnacle's line is the market consensus

### The 80/20 Rule of Line Shopping
- 80% of your value comes from 20% of your effort
- Check 3-4 books per bet, that's enough
- Pinnacle/Circa + DraftKings + FanDuel covers most scenarios

## 5. Identifying +EV Bets

### Expected Value Formula
```
EV = (Probability of Win × Profit) - (Probability of Loss × Stake)
```

**Example:**
- You estimate Chiefs have 57% chance to cover -3
- Line is -110 (bet $110 to win $100)
- EV = (0.57 × $100) - (0.43 × $110) = $57 - $47.30 = **+$9.70**

### Break-Even Implied Probability
| American Odds | Break-Even % |
|---------------|--------------|
| -150 | 60.0% |
| -130 | 56.5% |
| -120 | 54.5% |
| -110 | 52.4% |
| -105 | 51.2% |
| +100 | 50.0% |
| +110 | 47.6% |
| +120 | 45.5% |
| +150 | 40.0% |
| +200 | 33.3% |

### When You've Found Value
- Your estimated probability > Break-even probability = **+EV**
- Example: You think 55% chance, odds imply 52.4% = **+2.6% edge**
- Bet sizing: 1-2 units on +2% edge, 2-3 units on +5% edge

## 6. Closing Line Value (CLV)

### The #1 Indicator of Betting Skill
CLV = Comparing your bet odds to the closing line (at kickoff).

**Example:**
- You bet Chiefs -2.5 (-110) on Tuesday
- Line closes at Chiefs -3.5 (-110) on Sunday
- You got +1 point of CLV → **You beat the market**

### Why CLV Matters
- If you consistently get positive CLV, you'll be profitable long-term
- The closing line is the most efficient (reflects all information)
- Beating it means you had information/edge before the market

### Tracking CLV
- Record your bet time and odds
- Record closing line and odds
- Calculate point differential
- Positive CLV over 100+ bets = You're a winning bettor

### CLV in Practice
| Time Bet | Your Line | Closing Line | CLV |
|----------|-----------|--------------|-----|
| Tuesday | Chiefs -2.5 | Chiefs -3.5 | +1.0 ✓ |
| Sunday morning | Bills +3 | Bills +3 | 0.0 |
| Sunday morning | Ravens -7 | Ravens -6.5 | -0.5 ✗ |

## 7. Line Movement Patterns

### Steam Moves
- Sudden, significant movement across ALL books simultaneously
- Usually indicates syndicate/sharp action
- If you see Chiefs go from -3 to -4 across 5 books in 10 minutes = Steam

### Reverse Line Movement (RLM)
- 75% of bets on Team A, but line moves TOWARD Team B
- Books respect sharp money > public volume
- **RLM is one of the strongest predictive signals**

### Opening Line to Closing Line
| Pattern | Interpretation |
|---------|----------------|
| Opens -3, closes -5 | Sharp money on favorite early |
| Opens -3, closes -2 | Sharp money on underdog |
| Opens -3, stays -3 despite 80% on one side | Books comfortable, possible trap |

### When to Bet
- **If you have edge**: Bet early (before line moves against you)
- **If following sharps**: Wait for RLM, then follow
- **If uncertain**: Bet at closing line (most efficient)

## 8. Odds Boost & Promo Value

### Evaluating Odds Boosts
Books offer "boosted" odds as promotions. Some are +EV.

**Example:**
- Standard: Mahomes 300+ yards at +200 (33.3% implied)
- Boost: Mahomes 300+ yards at +250 (28.6% implied)
- If you think true probability is 35%, boost is +EV

### Red Flags on Boosts
- Boosts on high-juice parlays (they're giving back their edge)
- Boosts on extremely unlikely outcomes (PR, not value)
- Boosts with restrictive terms (max $10 bet)

### Promo Stacking
- Sign-up bonuses: Typically $200-$500 in bonus bets
- Weekly promos: Profit boosts, parlay insurance
- Referral bonuses: $50-$100 per referred user
- **Promo value can be worth 5-10% of your bankroll annually**

## 9. Building Your Line Shopping Workflow

### Pre-Game Workflow (Day Before)
1. **Identify games you want to bet** (2-4 per week max)
2. **Check consensus line** (Action Network or OddsShark)
3. **Note any significant deviations** (1+ point off consensus)
4. **Set price target** ("I'll bet Chiefs -3 at -110 or better")

### Bet Execution Workflow
1. **Open 3-4 book apps** (have accounts funded)
2. **Compare current lines** for your target game
3. **Execute at best price** (save 5-10 cents when possible)
4. **Record bet** (line, juice, book, time)

### Post-Game Workflow
1. **Record closing line** for CLV calculation
2. **Track result** (Win/Loss/Push)
3. **Weekly review**: Which books consistently offer best lines?

## 10. Common Line Shopping Mistakes

### Mistake #1: Betting Without Checking Multiple Books
- "I always use DraftKings" = Leaving money on the table
- 5 cents saved per bet × 200 bets/year = 10+ units saved

### Mistake #2: Paying for Half Points That Don't Matter
- Buying from -8 to -7.5 is usually NOT worth it (not a key number)
- Only buy through 3 and 7

### Mistake #3: Ignoring Juice
- Chiefs -3 (-105) is better than Chiefs -3 (-115)
- That 10-cent difference compounds over time

### Mistake #4: Not Having Multiple Funded Accounts
- You can't shop if you only have one account
- Minimum: 3 major books (DraftKings, FanDuel, one other)
- Ideal: 5+ books for maximum line flexibility

### Mistake #5: Waiting Too Long
- If you have edge, bet early
- Lines move quickly on sharp info
- Being 30 minutes late can cost you 0.5-1 point
