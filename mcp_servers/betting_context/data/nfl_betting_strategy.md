# NFL Betting Strategy: Professional-Grade Analysis

## 1. Market Efficiency & Line Movement

### The NFL Market
The NFL is the most heavily bet and scrutinized sports league globally. By Sunday kickoff, lines reflect sharp consensus.

**Opening vs. Closing Line Value (CLV)**
- CLV is the #1 predictor of long-term betting success
- If you consistently bet lines that move in your direction, you're winning long-term
- Example: You bet Chiefs -2.5, line closes at Chiefs -3.5 → Positive CLV (+1 point)
- Track your CLV, not just your wins

**Reverse Line Movement (RLM)**
- When the public bets one side heavily, but the line moves the OTHER way → Sharp money
- Example: 75% of bets on Chiefs, but line moves from Chiefs -3 to Chiefs -2.5
- Books are more afraid of sharp money than public volume
- RLM is one of the strongest predictive signals

**Steam Moves**
- Sudden, coordinated line movement across ALL books simultaneously
- Usually indicates a betting syndicate or sharp consensus
- If you see a line move 1+ point in minutes across 5+ books, respect it

## 2. Key Numbers & Point Spread Math

### The Mathematical Foundation
NFL scoring creates clustering around specific margins due to FG (3) and TD+PAT (7).

| Margin | % of Games | Cumulative |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| 3      | 15.0%     | 15.0%      |
| 7      | 9.1%      | 24.1%      |
| 6      | 5.5%      | 29.6%      |
| 10     | 5.0%      | 34.6%      |
| 4      | 4.8%      | 39.4%      |
| 14     | 4.5%      | 43.9%      |
| 1      | 4.0%      | 47.9%      |

**Actionable Rules:**
- **-2.5 is 15% better than -3.5** (you win pushes at 3)
- **+3.5 is 15% better than +2.5** (you win losses at exactly 3)
- **Never lay -3.5 at -110** unless desperate. Buy to -3 or -2.5.
- **Wong Teasers**: 6-point teasers crossing both 3 and 7 have historical edge

### Wong Teaser Strategy (Stanford Wong)
A "Wong Teaser" is a 6-point, 2-team teaser that:
1. Moves a favorite from -7.5 to -8.5 **down through both 7 and 3** to -1.5 to -2.5
2. Moves an underdog from +1.5 to +2.5 **up through both 3 and 7** to +7.5 to +8.5

**Historical Win Rate**: ~52-53% per leg needed to break even at -120. Wong teasers historically hit 72-74%.

## 3. Quarterback Impact on Spreads

### QB Tiers & Spread Adjustment
The NFL is a QB-driven league. No other position in sports impacts the point spread like an NFL QB.

| Tier | Examples | Spread Impact |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Elite | Mahomes, Allen, Burrow | 6-7 points |
| Above Average | Hurts, Herbert, Stroud | 4-5 points |
| Average | Cousins, Goff, Stafford | 2-3 points |
| Below Average | Fields, Jones, Brissett | 0-1 point |
| Backup | Most | -3 to -7 points |

**Injury Analysis Protocol:**
1. Check Wednesday practice report (first indicator)
2. Check Friday injury designation (Out/Doubtful/Questionable/Probable)
3. If QB is Questionable → Wait until Sunday morning for inactive list
4. Backup QB starting = Fade that team OR buy at adjusted line

**Key Backup Situations (2024 Context):**
- If a team loses their starter, expect 4-7 point line swing
- The market often OVER-adjusts initially. Sometimes fading the backup is wrong.
- Exception: Elite backups (rare) or run-heavy offenses less affected

---

## 4. Situational Betting Angles

### Proven Situational Spots

**1. West Coast Teams Playing 1pm ET Road Games**
- Body clock says 10am when game starts
- Historical ATS: ~47% (below break-even)
- Strongest fade when team also traveled Thursday

**2. Lookahead / Sandwich Spots**
- Team plays weak opponent BEFORE a massive rivalry game
- Example: Cowboys vs. Panthers before Cowboys vs. Eagles
- Fade the favorite in the "trap" game

**3. Thursday Night Football (TNF) Road Teams**
- Only 4 days to prepare + travel
- Road teams on TNF: ~45% ATS historically
- Especially strong if road team played Monday the week before

**4. Divisional Unders**
- Teams that play twice per year know each other intimately
- Divisional game totals hit Under at ~53-54%
- Defenses adjust better when they've seen the same offense recently

**5. Revenge Games**
- Team lost to opponent badly (<14+ points) in last meeting
- Teams in revenge spots cover at ~54% ATS
- Even stronger when combined with home field

**6. Short Rest Mismatches**
- Team A: 10+ days rest (bye week)
- Team B: 4 days rest (TNF the week before)
- Rest advantage = ~1-2 point edge to rested team

---

## 5. Weather Impact Analysis

### Wind (Most Important)
| Wind Speed | Recommended Action |
|------------|-------------------|
| <10 mph | No adjustment |
| 10-15 mph | Slight Under lean |
| 15-20 mph | Strong Under lean, fade passing QBs |
| 20+ mph | HAMMER the Under, avoid totals plays |

**Wind affects:**
- Passing accuracy
- Field goal range (reduced by 5-10 yards per 10mph)
- Punt distance

### Temperature
- Cold alone (<30°F) has minimal impact
- Cold + Wind = Compounding effect
- Dome teams traveling to cold weather: Slight fade

### Rain/Snow
- Rain: Slight Under lean (3-5% edge)
- Snow: Avoid or Under lean
- Heavy precipitation: Pass-heavy teams struggle more

## 6. Advanced Metrics to Track

### Offensive Metrics
- **EPA/Play** (Expected Points Added): Best single efficiency metric
- **Success Rate**: % of plays gaining 50%+ of needed yards (1st down), 70%+ (2nd), 100% (3rd/4th)
- **DVOA** (Football Outsiders): Adjusts for opponent strength

### Defensive Metrics
- **Pressure Rate**: % of dropbacks with pressure (without blitzing = better)
- **EPA/Play Allowed**: Inverse of offensive EPA
- **Yards After Contact**: RB skill metric

### Red Zone Efficiency
- **RZ TD%**: Teams regress heavily toward mean (league avg ~55-60%)
- If a team has 80% RZ TD%, expect regression
- If a team has 40% RZ TD%, expect improvement

## 7. Line Shopping & Expected Value

### The Math of Line Shopping
Having accounts at 3+ sportsbooks can increase your ROI by 1-3%.

**Example:**
- Book A: Chiefs -3 (-110)
- Book B: Chiefs -2.5 (-115)
- Book C: Chiefs -3 (-105)

If you're betting Chiefs, Book C saves you 5 cents of juice. Over 1,000 bets, that's 50 units saved.

### Expected Value (EV) Formula
```
EV = (Win Probability × Profit) - (Loss Probability × Stake)
```

**Example:**
- You estimate Chiefs have 55% chance to cover -3
- Odds: -110 (bet $110 to win $100)
- EV = (0.55 × $100) - (0.45 × $110) = $55 - $49.50 = **+$5.50 per bet**

### Implied Probability from Odds
| American Odds | Implied Probability |
|---------------|---------------------|
| -200 | 66.7% |
| -150 | 60.0% |
| -110 | 52.4% |
| +100 | 50.0% |
| +150 | 40.0% |
| +200 | 33.3% |

**Formula:**
- Negative odds: `Odds / (Odds + 100)`
- Positive odds: `100 / (Odds + 100)`

---

## 8. Bankroll Integration

### Unit Sizing by Confidence
| Confidence Level | Units | When to Use |
|------------------|-------|-------------|
| 1u (Standard) | 1% | Most bets |
| 2u (Confident) | 2% | Strong situational + data alignment |
| 3u (Max) | 3% | CLV + RLM + Situational confluence |

**Never exceed 3u on a single game.** Even "locks" lose 40%+ of the time.

## 9. Building a Bet Slip (Multi-Bet Strategy)

### Correlation in Parlays
Some parlays have positive correlation (outcomes are linked):
- Team ML + Game Under (winning team often runs clock)
- Team -6.5 + Team TT Over 24.5 (need to score to cover)
- Rain game + Under (weather affects both)

### Same Game Parlay (SGP) Edges
Books price SGP legs independently but outcomes are correlated:
- QB rushing yards Over + Team rushing yards Over (same plays)
- WR1 receiving yards Over + Team passing yards Over (obviously linked)

### Recommended Portfolio Approach
- **60% Straight Bets**: Your bread and butter
- **30% 2-Team Teasers/Parlays**: Wong teasers or correlated parlays only
- **10% Longshot/SGP**: Entertainment budget

## 10. Red Flags & Traps to Avoid

### Public Trap Games
- Primetime games (SNF/MNF) attract casual money on big names
- Teams "due" to win after losing streak (gambler's fallacy)
- Revenge narratives pushed by media

### Sharp Trap Indicators
- Line opens at a key number (+3) and STAYS there despite 70%+ public on one side
- Books want balanced action. If they're not moving, they're comfortable.

### Recency Bias
- Team looks amazing in Week 5, everyone bets them Week 6
- Sample size of 5 games means almost nothing statistically
- Trust preseason power ratings more than early-season results
