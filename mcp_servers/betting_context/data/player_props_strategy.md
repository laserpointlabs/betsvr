# Player Props & PrizePicks Strategy Guide

## 1. Understanding Player Props

### What Are Player Props?
Player props are bets on individual player performance, independent of game outcome.

**Common NFL Props:**
- Passing yards (O/U 275.5)
- Rushing yards (O/U 85.5)
- Receiving yards (O/U 65.5)
- Touchdowns (Anytime TD scorer)
- Completions, Attempts, Interceptions
- Receptions (O/U 5.5)

### PrizePicks Specific
PrizePicks uses a "fantasy points" model where you pick 2-6 players Over/Under their projected line.
- **2-pick**: 3x payout
- **3-pick**: 6x payout
- **4-pick**: 10x payout
- **5-pick**: 20x payout
- **6-pick**: 25x payout

**Key Insight**: PrizePicks removes the vig. You're betting against their projections, not -110 juice.

## 2. Finding Value in Props

### Why Props Have More Inefficiency
- Sportsbooks focus resources on game lines (where volume is highest)
- Player props are often set by algorithms with less human oversight
- Injury news, weather, and matchup data take longer to be reflected in props

### The Value Identification Process

**Step 1: Establish a Baseline**
- What is this player's season average?
- What is their median performance? (More stable than mean)
- What is their floor/ceiling range?

**Step 2: Adjust for Matchup**
- Is the opposing defense elite or terrible against this position?
- Example: WR vs. #1 CB or vs. #32 CB makes a 20%+ difference

**Step 3: Adjust for Game Script**
- Is this team favored heavily? (Less passing, more rushing in 2nd half)
- Is this team a big underdog? (Garbage time passing boost)
- What is the projected total? (High total = more offensive plays)

**Step 4: Adjust for Weather**
- Wind 15+ mph = Fade passing props, boost rushing props
- Rain = Reduce passing/receiving, boost rushing

**Step 5: Adjust for Injuries/Absences**
- Is WR2 out? WR1 gets more targets
- Is the starting RB out? Backup gets all the work
- Is a key OL out? QB gets less time, RB faces more stacked boxes

## 3. QB Passing Yards Strategy

### Factors That Inflate Passing Yards
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Underdog by 7+ | +15-25 yards (garbage time) |
| High total (50+) | +10-20 yards |
| Facing bottom-10 pass defense | +20-30 yards |
| Indoors/no wind | +10-15 yards |
| Opponent allows high completion % | More attempts completed |

### Factors That Deflate Passing Yards
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Heavy favorite (-10+) | -20-40 yards (run clock) |
| Low total (40 or under) | -20-30 yards |
| Facing top-5 pass defense | -20-40 yards |
| Wind 15+ mph | -30-50 yards |
| Rain/Snow | -20-40 yards |

### QB Passing Props Playbook
- **Smash the Over**: Underdog QB + High total + Weak defense + Good weather
- **Smash the Under**: Big favorite QB + Low total + Elite defense OR bad weather
- **Avoid**: Close games with average defenses (high variance)

## 4. RB Rushing Yards Strategy

### Factors That Inflate Rushing Yards
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Favorite by 7+ | +15-25 yards (running clock) |
| Facing bottom-10 run defense | +10-20 yards |
| Opponent allows high YPC | Efficiency boost |
| Poor weather (rain/wind) | Game script favors runs |
| RB is primary back (90%+ snaps) | Volume guaranteed |

### Factors That Deflate Rushing Yards
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Underdog by 7+ | -15-30 yards (abandoned run game) |
| Facing top-5 run defense | -10-25 yards |
| RB is in committee (50-60% snaps) | Carries stolen |
| Fast-paced opponent | Fewer possessions for your team |

### RB Rushing Props Playbook
- **Smash the Over**: Favorite + Bad run defense + Feature back + Poor weather
- **Smash the Under**: Big underdog + Elite run defense OR committee back
- **Check**: Backup RB usage, goal-line vultures (steal TDs)

---

## 5. WR/TE Receiving Yards Strategy

### Target Share is King
- A WR's production is largely a function of their target share
- **Target share = Player targets / Team total targets**
- Elite WR1s command 25-30% target share
- If WR2 is injured, WR1 target share can spike to 35%+

### Factors That Inflate Receiving Yards
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| WR2/WR3 out (injury) | +15-30 yards |
| Facing soft zone coverage | More underneath catches |
| Team is underdog | More passing volume |
| High total | More offensive plays |
| Slot WR vs. LB in coverage | Mismatch city |

### Factors That Deflate Receiving Yards
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Shadow coverage by elite CB | -20-40 yards |
| Team is heavy favorite | Less need to pass |
| WR dealing with injury (playing through) | Reduced routes |
| Low total / Defensive game | Fewer opportunities |

### WR Receiving Props Playbook
- **Smash the Over**: Underdog team + Absent WR2 + High total + No shadow CB
- **Smash the Under**: Favorite team + Elite CB shadow + Low total
- **Check**: Is this WR the deep threat or possession guy? (Consistency varies)

## 6. Receptions Props (Often Overlooked Edge)

### Why Receptions Props Can Be Exploited
- Books focus on yards; receptions are secondary
- Short-passing offenses generate high completions with low yards
- Some WRs catch 8 passes for 50 yards consistently

### Factors for Over on Receptions
- Team runs short/quick passing game (West Coast offense)
- Slot receivers (more volume, shorter routes)
- Trailing team (check-down mania)
- PPR-format leagues make this especially trackable

### Red Flag for Unders
- Deep-threat WRs (4 catches for 120 yards profile)
- Teams with low pass attempt totals
- RBs who don't catch passes

---

## 7. Touchdown Props (High Variance)

### Anytime TD Scorer (ATTS)
- High variance, high juice (typically -120 to +200)
- Goal-line role is EVERYTHING

### Who Scores TDs?
| Position | % of TDs |
|----------|----------|
| RBs (goal-line backs) | ~45% |
| WR1 (red zone targets) | ~25% |
| TEs (red zone threats) | ~15% |
| QBs (rushing) | ~10% |
| Other | ~5% |

### ATTS Strategy
- **Bet**: Goal-line RBs on favorites (most carries inside the 5)
- **Bet**: Red zone target leaders (high RZ target share)
- **Avoid**: Deep-threat WRs (TDs are boom/bust)
- **Avoid**: Backup RBs unless starter is OUT

---

## 8. PrizePicks Specific Strategies

### Correlation in PrizePicks Picks
Since you're picking multiple players, correlation matters:

**Positive Correlation (Good to Stack):**
- QB + WR1 on same team (QB throws, WR catches)
- RB Over + Team implied to win big (run the clock)
- Two players from high total game (more plays for everyone)

**Negative Correlation (Avoid Stacking):**
- WR1 + WR2 on same team (they compete for targets)
- RB + QB from same team in close game (one takes from other)
- Two WRs facing each other (game script hurts one)

### PrizePicks Line Analysis
- PrizePicks lines are often slightly higher than sportsbook consensus
- They shade lines toward the Over (public loves Overs)
- **Look for Unders** when PrizePicks line is 5%+ above Vegas prop

### 3-Pick vs. 6-Pick Strategy
- **3-picks (6x payout)**: Best risk/reward, highest hit rate needed (~60%)
- **4-picks (10x payout)**: Good middle ground
- **5-6 picks**: Lottery tickets, low hit rate (<10%)

**Recommended**: Focus on 3-4 pick entries with high-confidence legs

## 9. Building a Props Portfolio

### Daily Prop Allocation
| Category | % of Bankroll | Risk Level |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| High-confidence singles | 50% | Low |
| Correlated 2-3 leg plays | 30% | Medium |
| Longshot 4-6 leg plays | 10% | High |
| Live props (in-game) | 10% | Variable |

### Tracking Your Props
- Track by prop TYPE (QB yards, RB yards, etc.)
- Track by situation (favorite, underdog, weather)
- Identify which prop types you're best at
- Double down on your strengths

## 10. Advanced: Prop Modeling

### Building Your Own Projections
1. **Baseline**: Player's last 5 games median (not mean)
2. **Matchup Adj**: +/- based on opponent rank at defending position
3. **Game Script Adj**: +/- based on spread and total
4. **Weather Adj**: +/- based on wind/rain
5. **Injury Adj**: +/- based on absences on either team

**Example:**
- Patrick Mahomes median last 5: 280 yards
- Facing #28 pass defense: +20 yards
- Chiefs -7 (run clock): -15 yards
- Total 48.5 (average): +0 yards
- Clear weather: +0 yards
- **Projection: 285 yards**
- PrizePicks line: 275.5 → **Lean Over**

### When Your Model Disagrees with the Line
- If your projection is 10%+ different than the line → Strong play
- If your projection is 5-10% different → Moderate play
- If your projection is within 5% → Pass, no edge

## 11. Common Prop Betting Mistakes

### Mistakes to Avoid
1. **Betting the "Over" on everyone**: Public bias, lines adjusted
2. **Ignoring game script**: A blowout kills props for the losing team
3. **Chasing big names**: Mahomes/Hill props are heavily juiced
4. **Not checking injury reports**: One absence changes everything
5. **Ignoring weather**: Wind destroys passing props
6. **Parlaying uncorrelated props**: Each leg is independent risk
7. **Not shopping lines**: DraftKings, FanDuel, PrizePicks all have different numbers

### Signs of a Bad Prop Bet
- Line seems "too easy" (public trap)
- High variance player (boom/bust weekly)
- No clear edge from matchup/situation analysis
- Just "gut feel" with no data backing
